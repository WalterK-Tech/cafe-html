                <p>You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell
                    everyone. How it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But then why fifty years in the
                    future when the spacecraft encounters a black hole does the computer call it an 'unknown entry
                    event'? Why don't they know? If they don't know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never
                    told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die down here. Just as a matter of deductive
                    logic.</p>
